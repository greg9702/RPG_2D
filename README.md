# RPG-game

Role play game project. <br>
Game made using SFML. <br>
### Requirements
- CMake
- g++
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)

### MAP

Map is stored in file game_files/map_template.txt as two dimension array.

### GUI

GUI can be called as "MVP" and all graphics are made by me :D <br>
It is just made as simple as possible, mainly for testing and developing purposes.
